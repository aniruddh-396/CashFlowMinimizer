The CashFlowMinimizer project is a financial tool that uses a graph structure and the Dijkstra algorithm to help individuals or businesses minimize their cash flow expenses by optimizing their payments and transactions
The CashFlowMinimizer project is a financial tool that helps individuals or businesses to minimize their cash flow expenses by optimizing their payments and transactions. The project is built on a graph structure that represents the financial transactions and relationships between various parties.

The graph consists of nodes that represent the parties involved in the transactions, such as individuals, businesses, and financial institutions. The edges represent the transactions between these parties, including loans, investments, and payments.

To minimize the cash flow expenses, the project uses the Dijkstra algorithm, a graph-based shortest path algorithm, to calculate the optimal path for each transaction. The algorithm determines the shortest path between the source and the destination node, which represents the most efficient way to complete the transaction while minimizing the associated costs.

The CashFlowMinimizer project allows users to input their financial data, including their cash flow statements, balance sheets, and transaction history, into the system. The system then analyzes this data and generates a graph that represents the user's financial relationships and transactions. The Dijkstra algorithm is applied to this graph to generate a list of optimized transactions that will minimize the user's cash flow expenses.
